# 
# Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
# If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and **the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.**
# 
# Return the minimum possible absolute difference.

# 
# Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
